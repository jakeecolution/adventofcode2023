## Advent of Code 2023
Language: Golang

I am mostly proficient in Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Golang. I am also familiar with C, C++, Java, and C#. I am working on mastery of Golang.

I am aiming for a minimum of 1 star per day, but I am hoping to get 2 stars per day.

I am also trying to be as proformant as possible. I am trying to make my code as fast as possible, and I am trying to make my code as memory efficient as possible.
